The IO BIO Project provides an open access online biographical dictionary with short biographies of Secretaries-General (SGs), or other executive heads with different titles, of International Organizations (IOs). The biographical literature on SGs is limited, giving an incomplete picture of the variety of people who have held these positions, their personal and professional trajectories and the interactions between them. IO BIO focuses on those SGs of intergovernmental organizations who have left a mark for any reason, whether good, bad or unusual.

IO BIO includes deceased SGs and those who have been out of office for five years or more and most probably will not return to office as SG. The short biographies (between 800 and 3,600 words) present an accurate and coherent description of the entire life and career of each SG. Entries provide biographical data, a balanced account of life and work, as well as references and a picture. To allow for group analyses (another IO BIO objective) authors are encouraged to pay attention to the social and professional connections of SGs. In 2010 IO BIO was set up at an International Studies Association Round Table and elaborated upon by a Panel in Montreal (2011) and a Round Table in San Diego (2012).

Entries have been published at the IO BIO website at Radboud University since November 2011. Scholars and practitioners are carrying out the IO BIO Project on a voluntary basis.
